2	"Most <e1>definitions</e1> of <e2>car</e2> say they run primarily on roads, seat one to eight people, have four tires, and mainly transport people rather than goods."
3	" <e1>Cars</e1> came into global <e2>use</e2> during the 20th century, and developed economies depend on them."
4	"The year 1886 is regarded as the birth year of the modern car when <e1>German</e1> inventor <e2>Karl Benz</e2> patented his Benz Patent - Motorwagen."
5	" <e1>Cars</e1> became widely available in the early 20th <e2>century</e2>."
6	"One of the first cars that were accessible to the masses was the 1908 <e1>Model T</e1>, an <e2>American</e2> car manufactured by the Ford Motor Company."
7	"Cars were rapidly adopted in the <e1>US</e1>, where they replaced animal - drawn carriages and carts, but took much longer to be accepted in <e2>Western Europe</e2> and other parts of the world."
8	" <e1>nCars</e1> have <e2>controls</e2> for driving, parking, passenger comfort and safety, and controlling a variety of lights."
9	"Over the <e1>decades</e1>, additional <e2>features</e2> and controls have been added to vehicles, making them progressively more complex."
10	" <e1>Examples</e1> include rear <e2>reversing</e2> cameras, air conditioning, navigation systems, and in - car entertainment."
11	"Most <e1>cars</e1> in <e2>use</e2> in the 2010s are propelled by an internal combustion engine, fueled by the combustion of fossil fuels."
12	"This causes <e1>air pollution</e1> and also contributes to climate <e2>change</e2> and global warming."
13	" <e1>Vehicles</e1> using alternative <e2>fuels</e2> such as ethanol flexible - fuel vehicles and natural gas vehicles are also gaining popularity in some countries."
14	"Electric <e1>cars</e1>, which were invented early in the <e2>history</e2> of the car, began to become commercially available in 2008."
15	"nThere are <e1>costs</e1> and <e2>benefits</e2> to car use."
16	"The <e1>costs</e1> include acquiring the <e2>vehicle</e2>, interest payments ( if the car is financed ), repairs and maintenance, fuel, depreciation, driving time, parking fees, taxes, and insurance."
17	"The <e1>costs</e1> to <e2>society</e2> include maintaining roads, land use, road congestion, air pollution, public health, health care, and disposing of the vehicle at the end of its life."
18	" <e1>Road traffic</e1> accidents are the largest <e2>cause</e2> of injury - related deaths worldwide."
19	"The <e1>benefits</e1> include on - <e2>demand transportation</e2>, mobility, independence, and convenience."
20	"The societal <e1>benefits</e1> include economic <e2>benefits</e2>, such as job and wealth creation from the automotive industry, transportation provision, societal well - being from leisure and travel opportunities, and revenue generation from the taxes."
21	"The <e1>ability</e1> for <e2>people</e2> to move flexibly from place to place has far - reaching implications for the nature of societies."
22	"It was estimated in 2014 that the <e1>number</e1> of <e2>cars</e2> was over 1."
23	"The numbers are increasing rapidly, especially in <e1>China</e1>, <e2>India</e2> and other newly industrialized countries."
24	"n\n\n== Etymology = = \nThe word car is believed to originate from the <e1>Latin</e1> word carrus or carrum ( \"wheeled <e2>vehicle\</e2> " ), or the Middle English word carre ( meaning \"two - wheel cart\ ", from Old North French )."
25	"In turn, these originated from the <e1>Gaulish</e1> word karros ( a <e2>Gallic</e2> chariot )."
26	"It originally referred to any wheeled <e1>horse</e1> - drawn <e2>vehicle</e2>, such as a cart, carriage, or wagon."
27	" <e1>Autocar\</e1> " is a <e2>variant</e2> that is also attested from 1895, but that is now considered archaic."
28	"The term \"horseless <e1>carriage\</e1> " was used by some to refer to the first <e2>cars</e2> at the time that they were being built, and is attested from 1895."
29	"The word \"automobile\ " is a classical compound derived from the Ancient <e1>Greek</e1> word <e2>aut\u00f3s</e2> ( \u03b1\u1f50\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2 ), meaning \"self\ ", and the Latin word mobilis, meaning \"movable\ "."
30	"It entered the <e1>English</e1> language from <e2>French</e2>, and was first adopted by the Automobile Club of Great Britain in 1897."
31	"Over time, the word \"automobile\ " fell out of favour in <e1>Britain</e1>, and was replaced by \"motor <e2>car\</e2> "."
32	"Automobile\ " remains chiefly <e1>North American</e1>, particularly as a formal or commercial <e2>term</e2>."
33	"The word is still very common as an adjective in <e1>American</e1> English, usually in compound formations like \"auto industry\ " and <e2>\"auto mechanic\</e2> "."
34	"In <e1>Dutch</e1> and <e2>German</e2>, two languages historically related to English, the abbreviated form \"auto\ " ( Dutch ) / \"Auto\ " ( German ), as well as the formal full version \"automobiel\ " ( Dutch ) / \"Automobil\ " ( German ) are still used \u2014 in either the short form is the most regular word for \"car\ "."
35	"n\n\n== History = = \n\nThe first working steam - powered vehicle was designed \u2014 and quite possibly built \u2014 by <e1>Ferdinand Verbiest</e1>, a <e2>Flemish</e2> member of a Jesuit mission in China around 1672."
36	"It was a 65-cm - long scale - model toy for the <e1>Chinese</e1> Emperor that was unable to carry a <e2>driver</e2> or a passenger."
37	"It is not known with certainty if <e1>Verbiest</e1> 's <e2>model</e2> was successfully built or ran."
38	"n\nNicolas - <e1>Joseph Cugnot</e1> is widely credited with building the first full - <e2>scale</e2>, self - propelled mechanical vehicle or car in about 1769; he created a steam - powered tricycle."
39	"He also constructed two steam tractors for <e1>the French Army</e1>, one of which is preserved in <e2>the French National Conservatory of Arts</e2> and Crafts."
40	"His <e1>inventions</e1> were, however, handicapped by <e2>problems</e2> with water supply and maintaining steam pressure."
41	"In 1801, <e1>Richard Trevithick</e1> built and demonstrated his Puffing Devil <e2>road</e2> locomotive, believed by many to be the first demonstration of a steam - powered road vehicle."
42	"It was unable to maintain sufficient <e1>steam pressure</e1> for long <e2>periods</e2>, and was of little practical use."
43	"nThe <e1>development</e1> of external <e2>combustion</e2> engines is detailed as part of the history of the car, but often treated separately from the development of true cars."
44	"A <e1>variety</e1> of <e2>steam</e2> - powered road vehicles were used during the first part of the 19th century, including steam cars, steam buses, phaetons, and steam rollers."
45	"nIn 1807, <e1>Nic\u00e9phore</e1> Ni\u00e9pce and his brother <e2>Claude</e2> created what was probably the world 's first internal combustion engine ( which they called a Pyr\u00e9olophore ), but they chose to install it in a boat on the river Saone in France."
46	"Coincidentally, in 1807 the <e1>Swiss</e1> inventor Fran\u00e7ois <e2>Isaac de Rivaz</e2> designed his own ' de Rivaz internal combustion engine ' and used it to develop the world 's first vehicle to be powered by such an engine."
47	"The Ni\u00e9pces ' Pyr\u00e9olophore was fuelled by a mixture of <e1>Lycopodium</e1> powder ( dried spores of the <e2>Lycopodium</e2> plant ), finely crushed coal dust and resin that were mixed with oil, whereas de Rivaz used a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen."
48	"Neither design was very successful, as was the case with others, such as <e1>Samuel Brown</e1>, <e2>Samuel Morey</e2>, and Etienne Lenoir with his hippomobile, who each produced vehicles ( usually adapted carriages or carts ) powered by internal combustion engines."
49	"n\nIn November 1881, <e1>French</e1> inventor <e2>Gustave Trouv\u00e9</e2> demonstrated the first working ( three - wheeled ) car powered by electricity at the International Exposition of Electricity, Paris."
50	"Although several other <e1>German</e1> engineers ( including <e2>Gottlieb Daimler</e2>, Wilhelm Maybach, and Siegfried Marcus ) were working on the problem at about the same time, Karl Benz generally is acknowledged as the inventor of the modern car."
51	" <e1>n\nIn 1879</e1>, <e2>Benz</e2> was granted a patent for his first engine, which had been designed in 1878."
52	"Many of his other <e1>inventions</e1> made the <e2>use</e2> of the internal combustion engine feasible for powering a vehicle."
53	"His first <e1>Motorwagen</e1> was built in 1885 in <e2>Mannheim</e2>, Germany."
54	"Benz began <e1>promotion</e1> of the <e2>vehicle</e2> on 3 July 1886, and about 25 Benz vehicles were sold between 1888 and 1893, when his first four - wheeler was introduced along with a model intended for affordability."
55	"They also were powered with four - <e1>stroke</e1> engines of his own <e2>design</e2>."
56	" <e1>Emile Roger</e1> of <e2>France</e2>, already producing Benz engines under license, now added the Benz car to his line of products."
57	"Because <e1>France</e1> was more open to the early cars, initially more were built and sold in <e2>France</e2> through Roger than Benz sold in Germany."
58	"In August 1888 <e1>Bertha Benz</e1>, the wife of <e2>Karl Benz</e2>, undertook the first road trip by car, to prove the road - worthiness of her husband 's invention."
59	" <e1>n\nIn 1896</e1>, <e2>Benz</e2> designed and patented the first internal - combustion flat engine, called boxermotor."
60	"During the last years of the nineteenth century, <e1>Benz</e1> was the largest car company in the world with 572 units produced in 1899 and, because of its size, <e2>Benz & Cie</e2>."
61	"The first motor car in central <e1>Europe</e1> and one of the first factory - made cars in the world, was produced by <e2>Czech</e2> company Nesselsdorfer Wagenbau ( later renamed to Tatra ) in 1897, the Pr\u00e4sident automobil."
62	" <e1>nDaimler</e1> and <e2>Maybach</e2> founded Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft ( DMG ) in Cannstatt in 1890, and sold their first car in 1892 under the brand name Daimler."
63	"It was a <e1>horse</e1> - drawn <e2>stagecoach</e2> built by another manufacturer, which they retrofitted with an engine of their design."
64	"By 1895 about 30 vehicles had been built by <e1>Daimler and Maybach</e1>, either at the <e2>Daimler</e2> works or in the Hotel Hermann, where they set up shop after disputes with their backers."
65	"Benz, <e1>Maybach</e1> and the <e2>Daimler</e2> team seem to have been unaware of each other 's early work."
66	"They never worked together; by the time of the merger of the two companies, <e1>Daimler</e1> and <e2>Maybach</e2> were no longer part of DMG."
67	" <e1>Daimler</e1> died in 1900 and later that year, <e2>Maybach</e2> designed an engine named Daimler - Mercedes that was placed in a specially ordered model built to specifications set by Emil Jellinek."
68	"This was a production of a small number of vehicles for <e1>Jellinek</e1> to <e2>race</e2> and market in his country."
69	"Two years later, in 1902, a new model DMG car was produced and the model was named <e1>Mercedes</e1> after the <e2>Maybach</e2> engine, which generated 35 hp."
70	" <e1>Maybach</e1> quit <e2>DMG</e2> shortly thereafter and opened a business of his own."
71	"Rights to the <e1>Daimler</e1> brand <e2>name</e2> were sold to other manufacturers."
72	" <e1>nKarl Benz</e1> proposed co - operation between DMG and <e2>Benz & Cie</e2>."
73	"when economic conditions began to deteriorate in <e1>Germany</e1> following <e2>the First World War</e2>, but the directors of DMG refused to consider it initially."
74	"Negotiations between the two companies resumed several years later when these conditions worsened and, in 1924 they signed an <e1>Agreement of Mutual Interest</e1>, valid until the <e2>year</e2> 2000."
75	"Both <e1>enterprises</e1> standardized <e2>design</e2>, production, purchasing, and sales and they advertised or marketed their car models jointly, although keeping their respective brands."
76	"and DMG finally merged as the <e1>Daimler - Benz</e1> company, baptizing all of its cars <e2>Mercedes Benz</e2>, as a brand honoring the most important model of the DMG cars, the Maybach design later referred to as the 1902 Mercedes-35 hp, along with the Benz name."
77	" <e1>Karl Benz</e1> remained a member of the board of directors of <e2>Daimler - Benz</e2> until his death in 1929, and at times his two sons also participated in the management of the company."
78	" <e1>n\nIn 1890</e1>, <e2>\u00c9mile Levassor</e2> and Armand Peugeot of France began producing vehicles with Daimler engines, and so laid the foundation of the automotive industry in France."
79	"In 1891, <e1>Auguste Doriot</e1> and his <e2>Peugeot</e2> colleague Louis Rigoulot completed the longest trip by a gasoline - powered vehicle when their self - designed and built Daimler powered Peugeot Type 3 completed 2,100 km ( 1,300 miles ) from Valentigney to Paris and Brest and back again."
80	"They were attached to the first <e1>Paris\u2013Brest\u2013Paris</e1> bicycle race, but finished 6 days after the winning cyclist, <e2>Charles Terront</e2>."
81	"nThe first design for an <e1>American</e1> car with a gasoline internal combustion engine was made in 1877 by <e2>George Selden</e2> of Rochester, New York."
82	"Selden applied for a <e1>patent</e1> for a <e2>car</e2> in 1879, but the patent application expired because the vehicle was never built."
83	"After a delay of sixteen years and a series of attachments to his application, on 5 November 1895, <e1>Selden</e1> was granted a <e2>United States</e2> patent ( U."
84	"His patent was challenged by <e1>Henry Ford</e1> and <e2>others</e2>, and overturned in 1911."
85	"nIn 1893, the first running, gasoline - powered <e1>American</e1> car was built and road - tested by the <e2>Duryea</e2> brothers of Springfield, Massachusetts."
86	"The first public run of <e1>the Duryea Motor Wagon</e1> took place on 21 September 1893, on <e2>Taylor Street</e2> in Metro Center Springfield."
87	" <e1>The Studebaker Automobile Company</e1>, <e2>subsidiary</e2> of a long - established wagon and coach manufacturer, started to build cars in 1897 and commenced sales of electric vehicles in 1902 and gasoline vehicles in 1904."
88	"In <e1>Britain</e1>, there had been several attempts to build steam cars with varying degrees of success, with <e2>Thomas Rickett</e2> even attempting a production run in 1860."
89	"Santler from <e1>Malvern</e1> is recognized by <e2>the Veteran Car Club of Great Britain</e2> as having made the first gasoline - powered car in the country in 1894, followed by Frederick William Lanchester in 1895, but these were both one - offs."
90	"The first production vehicles in <e1>Great Britain</e1> came from <e2>the Daimler Company</e2>, a company founded by Harry J."
91	" <e1>Lawson</e1> in 1896, after purchasing the <e2>right</e2> to use the name of the engines."
92	" <e1>Lawson</e1> 's company made its first car in 1897, and they bore the name <e2>Daimler</e2>."
93	"In 1892, <e1>German</e1> engineer <e2>Rudolf Diesel</e2> was granted a patent for a \"New Rational Combustion Engine\ "."
94	"Steam-, <e1>electric-</e1>, and <e2>gasoline</e2> - powered vehicles competed for decades, with gasoline internal combustion engines achieving dominance in the 1910s."
95	"Although various pistonless rotary engine designs have attempted to compete with the conventional piston and crankshaft design, only <e1>Mazda</e1> 's version of the <e2>Wankel</e2> engine has had more than very limited success."
96	" <e1>nAll</e1> in all, it is estimated that over 100,000 <e2>patents</e2> created the modern automobile and motorcycle."
97	" <e1>n\n\n== Mass</e1> production = = \n\nLarge - scale, production - line manufacturing of affordable cars was started by <e2>Ransom Olds</e2> in 1901 at his Oldsmobile factory in Lansing, Michigan and based upon stationary assembly line techniques pioneered by Marc Isambard Brunel at the Portsmouth Block Mills, England, in 1802."
98	"The <e1>assembly line style</e1> of <e2>mass production</e2> and interchangeable parts had been pioneered in the U."
99	"by <e1>Thomas Blanchard</e1> in 1821, at <e2>the Springfield Armory</e2> in Springfield, Massachusetts."
100	"This concept was greatly expanded by <e1>Henry Ford</e1>, beginning in 1913 with the world 's first moving assembly line for cars at the <e2>Highland Park Ford Plant</e2>."
101	"nAs a result, <e1>Ford</e1> 's <e2>cars</e2> came off the line in fifteen - minute intervals, much faster than previous methods, increasing productivity eightfold, while using less manpower ( from 12."
102	"5-man - <e1>hours</e1> to 1 <e2>hour</e2> 33 minutes )."
103	"It was so successful, <e1>paint</e1> became a <e2>bottleneck</e2>."
104	"Only <e1>Japan</e1> black would dry fast enough, forcing the company to drop the variety of colors available before 1913, until fast - drying <e2>Duco</e2> lacquer was developed in 1926."
105	"This is the source of <e1>Ford</e1> 's apocryphal <e2>remark</e2>, \"any color as long as it 's black\ "."
106	"In 1914, an assembly line worker could buy a <e1>Model T</e1> with four <e2>months</e2> ' pay."
107	" <e1>Ford</e1> 's complex <e2>safety</e2> procedures\u2014especially assigning each worker to a specific location instead of allowing them to roam about\u2014dramatically reduced the rate of injury."
108	"The <e1>combination</e1> of high <e2>wages</e2> and high efficiency is called \"Fordism,\ " and was copied by most major industries."
109	"The <e1>assembly line</e1> forced <e2>workers</e2> to work at a certain pace with very repetitive motions which led to more output per worker while other countries were using less productive methods."
110	"nIn the automotive industry, its success was dominating, and quickly spread worldwide seeing the founding of <e1>Ford France</e1> and <e2>Ford Britain</e2> in 1911, Ford Denmark 1923, Ford Germany 1925; in 1921, Citroen was the first native European manufacturer to adopt the production method."
111	"Soon, <e1>companies</e1> had to have <e2>assembly</e2> lines, or risk going broke; by 1930, 250 companies which did not, had disappeared."
112	" <e1>Development</e1> of automotive <e2>technology</e2> was rapid, due in part to the hundreds of small manufacturers competing to gain the world 's attention."
113	"Key developments included electric ignition and the electric self - starter ( both by <e1>Charles Kettering</e1>, for <e2>the Cadillac Motor Company</e2> in 1910\u20131911 ), independent suspension, and four - wheel brakes."
114	"nSince the <e1>1920s</e1>, nearly all <e2>cars</e2> have been mass - produced to meet market needs, so marketing plans often have heavily influenced car design."
115	"Sloan who established the idea of different makes of cars produced by one company, called <e1>the General Motors Companion Make Program</e1>, so that <e2>buyers</e2> could \"move up\ " as their fortunes improved."
116	"nReflecting the rapid <e1>pace</e1> of <e2>change</e2>, makes shared parts with one another so larger production volume resulted in lower costs for each price range."
117	"For example, in the 1930s, <e1>LaSalles</e1>, sold by <e2>Cadillac</e2>, used cheaper mechanical parts made by Oldsmobile; in the 1950s, Chevrolet shared hood, doors, roof, and windows with Pontiac; by the 1990s, corporate powertrains and shared platforms ( with interchangeable brakes, suspension, and other parts ) were common."
118	"Even so, only major makers could afford high costs, and even companies with decades of production, such as <e1>Apperson</e1>, <e2>Cole</e2>, Dorris, Haynes, or Premier, could not manage: of some two hundred American car makers in existence in 1920, only 43 survived in 1930, and with the Great Depression, by 1940, only 17 of those were left."
119	" <e1>Morris</e1> set up its production line at <e2>Cowley</e2> in 1924, and soon outsold Ford, while beginning in 1923 to follow Ford 's practice of vertical integration, buying Hotchkiss ( engines ), Wrigley ( gearboxes ), and Osberton ( radiators ), for instance, as well as competitors, such as Wolseley: in 1925, Morris had 41 % of total British car production."
120	"Most <e1>British</e1> small - car assemblers, from <e2>Abbey</e2> to Xtra, had gone under."
121	" <e1>Citroen</e1> did the same in <e2>France</e2>, coming to cars in 1919; between them and other cheap cars in reply such as Renault 's 10CV and Peugeot 's 5CV, they produced 550,000 cars in 1925, and Mors, Hurtu, and others could not compete."
122	" <e1>Germany</e1> 's first mass - manufactured car, the <e2>Opel</e2> 4PS Laubfrosch ( Tree Frog ), came off the line at Russelsheim in 1924, soon making Opel the top car builder in Germany, with 37."
123	"5 <e1>%</e1> of the <e2>market</e2>."
124	"In <e1>Japan</e1>, car production was very limited before <e2>World War II</e2>."
125	"Only a handful of companies were producing vehicles in limited numbers, and these were small, three - wheeled for commercial uses, like <e1>Daihatsu</e1>, or were the result of partnering with <e2>European</e2> companies, like Isuzu building the Wolseley A-9 in 1922."
126	" <e1>Mitsubishi</e1> was also partnered with <e2>Fiat</e2> and built the Mitsubishi Model A based on a Fiat vehicle."
127	" <e1>Toyota</e1>, <e2>Nissan</e2>, Suzuki, Mazda, and Honda began as companies producing non - automotive products before the war, switching to car production during the 1950s."
128	" <e1>Kiichiro Toyoda 's</e1> decision to take <e2>Toyoda Loom Works</e2> into automobile manufacturing would create what would eventually become Toyota Motor Corporation, the largest automobile manufacturer in the world."
129	" <e1>Subaru</e1>, meanwhile, was formed from a conglomerate of six companies who banded together as <e2>Fuji Heavy Industries</e2>, as a result of having been broken up under keiretsu legislation."
130	"n\n\n== Fuel and propulsion technologies = = \n\nMost cars in use in the 2010s are propelled by an internal combustion engine, fueled by the deflagration ( rather than detonation ) combustion of hydrocarbon fossil fuels, mostly gasoline ( petrol ) and diesel, as well as some <e1>Autogas</e1> and <e2>CNG</e2>."
131	"Hydrocarbon <e1>fuels</e1> cause <e2>air pollution</e2> and contribute to climate change and global warming."
132	"Rapidly increasing <e1>oil</e1> prices, <e2>concerns</e2> about oil dependence, tightening environmental laws and restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions are propelling work on alternative power systems for cars."
133	" <e1>Efforts</e1> to improve or replace existing <e2>technologies</e2> include the development of hybrid vehicles, plug - in electric vehicles and hydrogen vehicles."
134	" <e1>Vehicles</e1> using alternative <e2>fuels</e2> such as ethanol flexible - fuel vehicles and natural gas vehicles are also gaining popularity in some countries."
135	" <e1>Cars</e1> for <e2>racing</e2> or speed records have sometimes employed jet or rocket engines, but these are impractical for common use."
136	"The <e1>BRIC</e1> countries are adding to this consumption; in December 2009 <e2>China</e2> was briefly the largest car market."
137	"n\n\n== User <e1>interface</e1> = = <e2>\n\nCars</e2> are equipped with controls used for driving, passenger comfort and safety, normally operated by a combination of the use of feet and hands, and occasionally by voice on 2000s - era cars."
138	"These <e1>controls</e1> include a <e2>steering wheel</e2>, pedals for operating the brakes and controlling the car 's speed ( and, in a manual transmission car, a clutch pedal ), a shift lever or stick for changing gears, and a number of buttons and dials for turning on lights, ventilation and other functions."
139	"Modern <e1>cars</e1> ' <e2>controls</e2> are now standardised, such as the location for the accelerator and brake, but this was not always the case."
140	" <e1>Controls</e1> are evolving in <e2>response</e2> to new technologies, for example the electric car and the integration of mobile communications."
141	"nSince the <e1>car</e1> was first invented, its <e2>controls</e2> have become fewer and simpler through automation."
